Not a good year but not that bad year either. Here is the events I remember from last year.

- Less work on Unity but busy on something else.
- Done some small golang projects, it looks better than node.js (at least on memory consumption)
- Big node.js project in beginning of the year, none in the late of the year.
- Angular.js!
- Life reset, new passport, new IC, new EP, new home, new job many new things!
- Voted outside the country (and after that got a coup and has a new regime!)

This year resolution,

- Travel more!
