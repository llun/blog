# Main site & blog posts

My main website and blog posts. ðŸ‘‰ https://www.llun.me

## Setup

1. Install all dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Add `.env.local` with these environment variabels, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`, `STRAVA_TOKEN`.
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is domain name for localhost, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. It uses for link
   in the page, so the link in localhost works locally. This is set to `https://llun.me` in
   Github. For `STRAVA_TOKEN`, generate access token with access to `read_all` and `activity:read_all`
   for fetching Strava activities and detail.
