Another end of year trip to Slovenia but this year is not a camper van.
We got an electric car this year with Citroën ë-C4 with the length in the winter
around 200km. The route from Bennekom, Netherlands to Slovenia has a lot
of super fast charging station, so it's not so bad with the EV car. Only
thing is bad in this trip is the traffic in Austria, on the highway A10,
south of Salzburg which we stuck in the traffic without moving for 2 hours!
