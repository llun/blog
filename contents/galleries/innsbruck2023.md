After stay in the Netherlands over a year with a very flat landscape (Masstricht has
some hills but can't compare it to the mountain.) This is a first trip to go to the
mountains area in Europe and also the trip I can try Nightjet, sleep train that I
can sleep a whole night and wake up at destination.

Innsbruck is the opposite of the Netherlands or Amsterdam. If Amsterdam is the city
under the sea, Innsbruck is kind of city with mountain that you can walk in the cloud.
The mountain is next to the city on all sides and you can take a cable cars to the top.

At the top of the mountains also have a lot of hike paths, a lot of places to climb the
rock, jump from the cliff. It's probably not as high as the mountain in north india but
it stills a wall when see from the city.

The weather when I went there is quite bad in the city because it's hot 30â„ƒ for
three days but good if you go out to the mountain because it's cooler. I probably go
back again in Winter to see how the city looks like in winter.
