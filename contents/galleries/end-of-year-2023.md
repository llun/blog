End of year 2023 camper van trip to Slovenia with a few stops along the way in Austria and Germany.
The long post in Thai is [here](https://www.llun.me/posts/2024-01-07-campervan-slovenia/).
Short summary

- The way to Slovenia, we stop at [Dettelbach, Germany](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Su76ckcQEzV2K4i17) and
  Fluchau, Austria. Dettelbach got flood and facility are mostly closed (no electricity for charging
  and no clean water) but gas station is near by with toilet!
  [Flachau, Austria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wo1rgZaWecx1eza79) is snowing and fleezing cold with
  ice floor at the Stellplatz, however the restuarant has toilet and some facility and the place is very
  very beautiful to stop (Just need to bring crampons next time).
- The way back to Netherlands, we stop at [Bernau am Chiemsee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wXLwqFmgHf46EBJZ7),
  Germany but got the wind warning with very strong wind and we afraid that the roof top will get blow away,
  so we moved to [the hotel in Rossenheim](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ktbnCW7HGCpWTPxr7). The stellplatz in
  Chiemsee has all the facility, toilet, shower, clean water and electricity for charging, it would be
  perfect stop if the wind is not so bad. Another stop is in the farm land in
  [Nidderrau, Germany](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JWbfhV1gPd2yF9uaA) which has electricity and clean water
  however, it's quite far for any nearby toilet in the winter which is only downside for this stop.
  The restuarant at the place only open after April and summer, so coming here in summer would be nice
  stop.
- Hiking and cycling a few places in Slovenia, Ljubljana, Maribor, Litija and Lake Bled
