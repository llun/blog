I was cycling pass through this last year when [riding to Houtribdijk](https://www.strava.com/activities/7290957539)
and crossing it to Enkhuizen and thought I will need to come back visiting this.

It never happen last year and completely forgot about this museum until today.
It's sunny in the morning and the forecast looks good until afternoon so, I need
somewhere to visit instead of staying in the house (which I will need to do anyway
because of the rain in the afternoon) and found this musuem again in the map.

The museum has three parts, the ship, the wharf and the museum building. The first
two is a must, the museum one is more like educational about the flevoland and
Lelystad (which also nice.) However, if you have kids, the museum is a good place
to leave you kids behind with the water gates playground.
